        <h2><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer">About Computers:</a></h2><br>
        <p>A computer is an electronic device that can store, process, and retrieve data. It is capable of performing a wide range of tasks, such as creating documents,
             editing photos and videos, browsing the internet, playing games, and more.
             A computer consists of various hardware components, including a central processing unit (CPU),
              memory, storage devices, input/output devices, and a power supply.<br> The software programs and 
              operating systems that run on the computer allow users to perform different functions and tasks. 
              Computers are used in various fields, such as education, healthcare, finance, engineering, 
              entertainment, and more.</p><br>

        <ul>
          <li><h3>Desktops:</h3></li><br>
          <P><i>Desktop computers</i> are a type of computer that is designed to be used on a desk or table. 
            They consist of a separate monitor, keyboard, and mouse, which are connected to the 
            computer's main processing unit (CPU) using cables. The CPU contains the computer's main 
            components, including the motherboard, processor, memory, and storage devices.<br><br>

            Desktop computers are typically more powerful than laptops or tablets, and they are 
            ideal for tasks that require a lot of processing power, such as video editing, gaming, and
             3D modeling. They are also easier to upgrade and maintain than other types of computers, 
             as the components are usually easier to access and replace.<br>
            <br>
            Desktop computers come in different sizes, from compact models that are designed to take up
             less space to larger models that offer more processing power and storage capacity. 
             They can run various operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, and they 
             are used in a wide range of industries, from education and healthcare to finance and 
             engineering.</P><br>
          <img src="desktop1.jpeg" alt="Types of computers"><br><br>

          <li><h3>Laptops:</h3></li><br>
          <p>Laptops are a type of portable computer that are designed to be used on the go. They 
            consist of a screen, keyboard, and touchpad (or external mouse), all housed in a single 
            unit. Laptops are powered by a rechargeable battery and can be used without being connected
             to a power source.<br><br>

            Laptops come in different sizes, from smaller models with screens as small as 11 inches,
             to larger models with screens up to 17 inches or more. They are also available in 
             different configurations, with varying amounts of processing power, memory, and storage
              capacity.<br><br>
            
            One of the key advantages of laptops is their portability. They are lightweight and compact,
             making them easy to carry around and use wherever you go. This makes them ideal for people
              who need to work on the go, such as students, business travelers, and digital nomads.</p><br><br>

              <img src="laptop.jpg" alt="Types of computers"><br><br>
          <li><h3>Tablets:</h3></li><br>
          <p>Tablets are a type of portable computer that are similar to laptops but differ in some key ways. 
            They are typically smaller and lighter than laptops, and they are designed to be used primarily with
             touch-based input, rather than a physical keyboard and mouse.<br><br>

            Tablets feature a touchscreen display and run on a mobile operating system, such as iOS 
            (for Apple iPads) or Android (for tablets from various manufacturers). They can be used for a 
            wide range of tasks, such as browsing the internet, watching videos, playing games, reading e-books, 
            and more. They are also capable of running various productivity apps, such as word processors, 
            spreadsheets, and presentation software.<br><br>
            
            One of the key advantages of tablets is their portability. They are lightweight and compact, 
            making them easy to carry around and use wherever you go. They are also great for consuming media,
             such as movies, TV shows, and music, as they offer a larger screen than a smartphone but are still 
             small enough to be held comfortably in one hand.</p><br><br>

             <img src="tablets.jpg" alt="Types of computers"><br><br>

          <li><h3>Servers and Mainframes:</h3></li><br>
          <p><i>Servers</i> and<i> Mainframes</i> are two types of computers that are designed to handle large-scale
             computing tasks and data processing.<br><br>

            Servers are specialized computers that are designed to provide services or resources
             to other computers on a network. They can be used to host websites, store and manage data,
              run applications, and more. Servers are typically more powerful than desktop computers
               and may have multiple processors, large amounts of memory, and storage capacity.<br><br>
            
            Mainframes, on the other hand, are high-performance computers that are designed to handle
             massive amounts of data processing and transactional processing. They are used by large 
             organizations, such as banks and insurance companies, to manage their critical data and 
             applications. Mainframes are typically large and expensive, and they may require
              specialized cooling and power systems to operate.<br><br>
            
            Both servers and mainframes are designed for reliability, security, and scalability, and 
            they are capable of handling high workloads and processing large amounts of data. They 
            often run specialized operating systems and software, and they may require specialized 
            training to operate and maintain.<br><br>
            
            Overall, servers and mainframes are critical components of modern computing infrastructure,
             providing the backbone for many of the services and applications that we use every day.</p>
